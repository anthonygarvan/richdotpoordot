# Inequality

This is an explorable simulation which demonstrates the emergence of systematic inequality from an egalitarian society, given initial disparities in resources and territorial mutations in survival strategy. It is a live, public, open source version of the model described in [THE EMERGENCE OF INEQUALITY IN SMALL-SCALE SOCIETIES:
SIMPLE SCENARIOS AND AGENT-BASED SIMULATIONS](http://faculty.washington.edu/easmith/Smith&ChoiMs-May06.pdf)

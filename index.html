                    <h4>A simulation of the emergence of inequality</h4>
                    <blockquote>A big family has cultivated fruitful soil; two little families nearby have
                    thankless and rebellious fields. The two poor families have to serve the
                    opulent family, or slaughter it; there is no difficulty in that. But one of the
                    two indigent families offers its arms to the rich family in exchange for
                    bread, while the other attacks and is defeated. The subservient family is
                    the origin of the servants and the workmen; the beaten family is the origin
                    of the slaves. 
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>â”€ Voltaire (from "Equality," Philosophical Dictionary, 1750)</p>
                    <h4>What it is</h4>
                    <p>This is a web-based version of the simulation described in <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/easmith/Smith&ChoiMs-May06.pdf">this</a> 2006 paper by anthropologist Eric Alden Smith and economist Jung-Kyoo Choi. The paper was the first to present a mathematical test of some of the theories about the emergence of inequality that philosophers, social scientists, and economists have been refining for centuries.</p>

                    <p>The simulation creates a world of dot people born into patches with various amounts of resources (greener = richer). At first, all dot people simply share the resources with other dot people on their patch. These first dot people are called Doves. All dot people reproduce at a rate proportional to their income (you can set the rate of proportionality with the slider).</p>

                    <p>When a new dot person is born, there is some probability (I keep it at 10%) that the new dot baby will have a <em>different</em> survival strategy. It could become a Solo, which is a type that does not tolerate other dot people on its patch, and will pay a price to defend the patch. Once a Solo occupies a patch, it kills off the others and keeps it until it dies. Or it could become a Patron or Client. Patrons are territorial like Solo's, but they engage in trade with Clients, giving up some of their resources for labor from the Clients, as long as it profits them overall (you can play around with the Patron's revenue from the Client with the slider). Client's are like Dove's in that they are willing to share their patch, but they also engage in trade with their Patron. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Every year, every dot reaps income from its patch, the Patrons and Clients engage in trade, and dot people are born and die according to their total income.</p>

                    <h4>How it behaves</h4>
                    <p>I encourage you to play with it yourself and see! But here's the gist: When trade is very profitable, Patrons and Clients generally dominate. When reproduction rates are high, doves are prevalent, since they breed quickly enough to dominate the resources before other strategies can take hold. When reproduction rates are lower, but trade is not very profitable, one of the two territorial strategies will dominate (Solo's or Patron's).</p>

                    <h4>Why it's important</h4>
                    <p>Inequality is a fact of the world, today more than ever. Our complex economies produce feedback loops that are much more powerful than the ones described in the model, and build on themselves over centuries. That inequality doesn't tell us about who we are, it tells us who happened to land on a green patch.</p>
